## Course 8a VRND High Immersion Specialization ##

### Name: Yasser Makram

*Headset:* Vive
*Time Taken:* 40 hours
*Liked:* Employing 6DOF in an engaging and immersive experience
*Challenging:* Customizing SteamVR interaction system. I deviated a little bit from instructions and used the SteamVR interaction system to experience the challenges faced while customizing ready made components. For example reading Throwable code and using it as a guide to implement a new Movable behavior.
